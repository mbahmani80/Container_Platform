# Use Registry

# What is Docker container registry?
# Container Registry is a single place for your team to manage Docker images, perform vulnerability analysis, and decide who can access what with fine-grained access control. Existing CI/CD integrations let you set up fully automated Docker pipelines to get fast feedback.

# This example is based on the environment below.

+---------------------------+    |    +------------------------+
| NFS Server, www Server    |    |    | Docker CE, NFS Client  |
| Docker Registry,Docker CE |    |    |                        |
| masternode1.itstorage.net +----+----+ docker1.itstorage.net  |
| 192.168.37.50             |         | 192.168.37.51          |

You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

# Get SSL Certificates from Let's Encrypt who provides Free SSL Certificates.
# Refer to the details for Let's Encrypt official site below.
# ⇒ https://letsencrypt.org/
# By the way, expiration date of a cert is 90 days, so you must update within next 90 days later.

# install from EPEL
[root@masternode1 ~]# yum --enablerepo=epel -y install certbot
#2.2.2	Get certificates.
# It needs Web server like Apache httpd or Nginx must be runing on the server you work.
# Furthermore, it needs that it's possible to access from the Internet to your working server on port 80 because of verification from Let's Encrypt.
# for the option [--webroot], use a directory under the webroot on your server as a working temp
# -w [document root] -d [FQDN you'd like to get certs]
# FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) : Hostname.Domainname
# if you'd like to get certs for more than 2 FQDNs, specify all like below
# ex : if get [itstorage.net] and [masternode1.itstorage.net]
# ⇒ specify [-d itstorage.net -d masternode1.itstorage.net]

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/masternode1.itstorage.net/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/masternode1.itstorage.net/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2018-05-22. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
   again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
   "certbot renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
 - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

# success if [Congratulations] is shown
# certs are created under the [/etc/letsencrypt/live/(FQDN)/] directory

# cert.pem       ⇒ SSL Server cert(includes public-key)
# chain.pem      ⇒ intermediate certificate
# fullchain.pem  ⇒ combined file cert.pem and chain.pem
# privkey.pem    ⇒ private-key file

#2.2.3	If no Web Server is running on your working server, it's possbile to get certs with using Certbot's Web Server feature. Anyway, it needs that it's possible to access from the Internet to your working server on port 80 because of verification from Let's Encrypt.
# for the option [--standalone], use Certbot's Web Server feature
# -d [FQDN you'd like to get certs]
# FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) : Hostname.Domainname
# if you'd like to get certs for more than 2 FQDNs, specify all like below
